/**
 * By default, Offline makes an XHR request to load your /favicon.ico to check
 * the connection. If you don't have such a file, it will 404 in the console,
 * but otherwise work fine (even a 404 means the connection is up). You can
 * change the URL it hits (an endpoint which will respond with a quick 204 is
 * perfect)
 * <p>
 * 
 * 
 * Make sure that the URL you check has the same origin as your page (the
 * connection method, domain and port all must be the same), or you will run
 * into CORS issues. You can add Access-Control headers to the endpoint to fix
 * it on modern browsers, but it will still cause issues on IE9 and below.
 * 
 * If you do want to run tests on a different domain, try the {@link ImageCheck}
 * method. It loads an image, which are allowed to cross domains.
 * <p>
 * The one cavet is that with the image method, we can't distinguish a 404 from
 * a genuine connection issue, so any error at all will appear to Offline as a
 * connection issue.
